## Abstract
Self-driving vehicles represent a technological leap forward that can offer solutions to current
transportation problems and dramatically change how people approach mobility. The development
of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles has progressed at an unanticipated pace. Fuelled by
advances in artificial intelligence, cars are getting smart enough to begin to drive themselves. But
autonomous vehicles will do more than change how we get around. They have the potential to
dramatically reduce the number of car crashes, shrink carbon emissions, and provide mobility to
people who can’t drive.
Driverless cars weren't possible until researchers adopted an AI technique known as deep learning,
which relies on powerful GPUs, access to vast troves of data, and sophisticated algorithms for deep
neural networks to solve complex problems. Deep learning is essential for autonomous vehicles
because no one can write software that anticipates every possible scenario a self-driving car might
encounter. With deep learning, the car’s computer can learn, adapt, and improve. This technology
could transform the very interaction between society and its transportation system in ways that are
scarcely imagined. Or, this technology could simply become a better cruise control for private autos
or support current auto-oriented transportation and land use trends. Self-driving technology will
likely be brought to market in the near future. Some of the world’s biggest companies, including
GM, Google, BMW, and Volvo, are investing heavily in technologies designed to get humans out
from behind the wheel. Building a Self-driving car is time consuming to set up everything, not very
safe, less convenient and definitely not budget friendly. So the main idea of the project is to mimic
the working of self-driving car using a remote controlled car and some of the open source
software’s available for deep learning.
